php-shared-functions
====================

Reusable functions to provide many of the common PHP needs of library and other applications   Many of these functions are very tied to our local setup. They are however provided with the hope that they can be adapted to meet your needs. 

Originally created by Craig Spurrier from the University of South Carolina, Columbia during work for the University Libraries and William Gilmore Simms Initiatives. Adapted to GIT by Jason Steelman and supported by the IMREE development team at Thomas Cooper Library. Craig's original code (and other useful developments of his from his library days) are available at http://library.sc.edu/systems/oss
